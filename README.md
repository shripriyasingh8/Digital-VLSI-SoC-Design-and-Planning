# Digital-VLSI-SoC-Design-and-Planning-Program
# Overview
This is a two-week long workshop conducted by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM. This course provides a comprehensive outlook of the RTL2GDSII flow, making us understand how to convert high-level designs into a format ready for silicon fabrication. This repository showcases my learnings and work regarding the same. 
# Tools Used
**_Sky130 PDK_**: The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry. SkyWater and Googleâ€™s collaboration is now making this technology accessible to everyone!
