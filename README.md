# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program
## Overview
This is a two-week long workshop conducted by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM. This course provides a comprehensive outlook of the RTL2GDSII flow, making us understand how to convert high-level designs into a format ready for silicon fabrication. This repository demonstrates my learnings and work regarding the same. 
## Tools Used
1. **_Sky130 PDK_**: The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry. SkyWater and Googleâ€™s collaboration is now making this technology accessible to everyone!

**3. To Calculate the Flop Ratio:**
   
   $$
   Flop \ Ratio = \frac{No. \ of \ D \ Flip-Flops}{Total \ no. \ of \ cells}=\frac{1613}{14876}=0.108429
   $$

## Day 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells
## Chip Floor planning considerations
* ### Core: 
  A 'core' is the section of the chip where the fundamental design of the logic is placed.
* ### Die:
  A 'die', which consists of core, is small semiconductor material speciman on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated. 
* ### Utilisation factor: 
$$
Utilization \ Factor = \frac{Area \ occupied \ by \ netlist}{Total \ area \ of \ the \ core}
$$
* ### Aspect Ratio: 
$$
Aspect \ Ratio = \frac{Height \ of \ the \ core}{Width \ of \ the \ core}
$$
## OBJECTIVES
**1. Run Floorplan using OpenLANE:**

**Once the Floorplanning has been executed, we can view the results in the 'Floorplan' directory and analyse factors like the 'Die Area':**

**2. To see the actual layout after Floorplan, we can use use the MAGIC Tool:**

We can use the command:-
```
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/02-01_11-58/results/floorplan/
```
```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &

```
