# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program
## Overview
This is a two-week long workshop conducted by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM. This course provides a comprehensive outlook of the RTL2GDSII flow, making us understand how to convert high-level designs into a format ready for silicon fabrication. This repository demonstrates my learnings and work regarding the same. 
## Tools Used
1. **_Sky130 PDK_**: The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry. SkyWater and Googleâ€™s collaboration is now making this technology accessible to everyone!
